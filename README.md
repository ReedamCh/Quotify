# 💬 Quotify

Hi! This is a small project I made to display random quotes. It's called "Quotify" because... well, it shows quotes 😄  
Still a work in progress, but already looking pretty cute.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Fetches a random quote using an API.
- Shows the quote and the author in a card.
- You can click a button to get a new quote.
- You can choose quote category (like love, life, motivation) 

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (made using Vite)
- Context API (for state sharing)
- Axios (to call the quote API)
- CSS3

---

## 🎯 Why I Made This

I'm refreshing my React and wanted to build something fun and tiny that uses API calls, global state, and a little styling.  
Also, I love quotes – so this just felt right!

---

## 🪄 Future Features (Hopefully Soon)

- Save quotes you love 💖
- Share via social media 🫂
- Maybe a dark mode...?(Might use ChakraUI for theme modes)🌓

---

## ⚠️ Status

> This project is still being worked on!  
It's super basic right now but I plan to make it better step-by-step. Stay tuned 🌱

---

## 🏁 How to Run It

1. Clone this repo  
2. Run `npm install`  
3. Then `npm run dev`  
4. Open browser at `http://localhost:5173` (Since it's vite)
